# LoxPy
My first Python endeavour

First goal is to get statistics data from Loxone Miniserver to InfluxDB and visualize it with Grafana.
First commit into this repo delivers just bare minimum, that is able to do just that with single measure.

As I am not a programmer and I have never written anything in Python, it won't look nice at the beginning, but I will improve...hopefully ;-)
